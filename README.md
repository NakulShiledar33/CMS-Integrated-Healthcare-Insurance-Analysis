CMS-Integrated-Healthcare-Insurance-Analysis

 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has access to a vast amount of
 information about healthcare insurance plans, including information on plan pricing,
 features, provider networks, and other factors. CMS must thoroughly investigate and
 examine this data in order to make wise selections and raise the caliber of healthcare
 insurance services. The issue is figuring out how to get the most useful information out
 of the data that has been provided so that you can use it to guide policy choices,
 optimize plan options, and improve the healthcare insurance system as a whole.
 
 **Business Context:**
 The business goal for CMS is to leverage data analytics and exploration to improve the
 efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare insurance plans. This involves understanding
 the relationships and variations in plan rates, benefits, age groups, and provider
 networks across states. 
 The key components of the business definition include:
 
 **1. State-wise Variation:** Understand how healthcare plan rates and benefits vary
 across different states. Identify states with the highest and lowest plan rates, as
 well as variations in coverage benefits.

 **2. Age Group Analysis:** Explore how plan rates vary by age groups. Identify any
 trends or patterns that can help tailor insurance plans to different age
 demographics.

 **3. Cross-Year Analysis:** Utilize the Crosswalk2023.csv file to join data across
 multiple years (e.g., 2022 and 2023) and identify trends or changes in the
 healthcare insurance landscape over time.

 **4. Policy Recommendations:** Based on the insights gained, develop policy
 recommendations to optimize healthcare insurance offerings, improve
 affordability, and enhance the overall quality of service

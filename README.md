# CMS-Integrated-Healthcare-Insurance-Analysis-
CMS has extensive data on healthcare insurance plans, including pricing, features, and provider networks. To improve healthcare insurance services, CMS needs to effectively analyze this data for insights that guide policy decisions, optimize plan options, and enhance the overall system's quality.


 The business goal for CMS is to leverage data analytics and exploration to improve the
 efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare insurance plans. This involves understanding
 the relationships and variations in plan rates, benefits, age groups, and provider
 networks across states. The key components of the business definition include:
**1. State-wise Variation:** Understand how healthcare plan rates and benefits vary
 across different states. Identify states with the highest and lowest plan rates, as
 well as variations in coverage benefits.
**2. Age Group Analysis:** Explore how plan rates vary by age groups. Identify any
 trends or patterns that can help tailor insurance plans to different age
 demographics.
 **3. Cross-Year Analysis:** Utilize the Crosswalk2023.csv file to join data across
 multiple years (e.g., 2022 and 2023) and identify trends or changes in the
 healthcare insurance landscape over time.
**4. Policy Recommendations:** Based on the insights gained, develop policy
 recommendations to optimize healthcare insurance offerings, improve
 affordability, and enhance the overall quality of service.
 In conclusion, CMS will be able to make wise judgments, improve the standard of
 healthcare services, and make sure that healthcare insurance is still readily available
 and reasonably priced for all Americans through data research and analysis of
 healthcare insurance data
